- mew pokemon machine moves are not handled yet, as it required too much change for nothing
- in gen 3, dive accessible in lgfr only by cheating, so in pokepedia we hide it
- in gen 3, default deoxys forms are different between version groups, so there is a specific process for them


select move_id, group_concat(vg.identifier,',') from pokemon_moves
left join pokemon p on pokemon_moves.pokemon_id = p.id
left join version_groups vg on pokemon_moves.version_group_id = vg.id
left join pokemon_move_methods pmm on pokemon_moves.pokemon_move_method_id = pmm.id
where p.id = 1 and vg.id IN (3,4) and pmm.id = 2
group by move_id
